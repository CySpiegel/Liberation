# Liberation
An arma 3 mission based on KP Liberation 96.6

This is my own custom version that is based off of KP Liberation 96.6. The additional features and customizations are mainly all AI behaveral modification and audio sensory feedback for the players. Almost every aspect of the AI is now generated dynamically on the fly depending on what the AI is experiancing. This allows for a much more realistic enemy encounter. Keep in mind this is meant to be a game mode not a simulation like my other missions so much of everything is over the top.

Preset is located in the repo
